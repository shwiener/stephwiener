			<p>I <b>love</b> to <em>travel</em></p>
		
			<p style="color: darkgreen;"> While, I have not traveled to many places, I look forward to some day going to the places I have yet to see. I will be studying abroad this spring in Denmark, so I am so excited to be based in Europe. Being in Copenhagen will allow me to see so many amazing and beautiful neighboring countries. </p>
