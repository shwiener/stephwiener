			<p style="font-size: 130%;">  Growing up in Scottsdale, Arizona, moving to Madison was a big change for me. Leaving everything I have ever known behind was hard, but has allowed me to grow into myself and savor my independence. Moving away has sparked my interest in travel and showed me the importance of challenging myself. Over the summer, I lived in Tel Aviv, Israel where I worked as a marketing intern for an Israeli-based company.

			<p style="font-size: 110%;"> When I am not doing schoolwork, I enjoy biking down Lakeshore Path, baking, listening to music, and doing yoga. On the weekends, I look forward to going to the farmer's market and trying new coffee shops.
